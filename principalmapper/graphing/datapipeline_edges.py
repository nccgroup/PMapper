    """For Data Pipeline, we do something a little different. The way people can use DataPipeline to pivot is
    to create a pipeline, then put a definition on the pipeline that creates an EC2 instance resource. The
    role that's used by the EC2 instance is the ultimate target. This requires:

    * datapipeline:CreatePipeline (resource "*")
    * datapipeline:PutPipelineDefinition (resource "*")
    * iam:PassRole for the Data Pipeline Role (which must trust datapipeline.amazonaws.com)
    * iam:PassRole for the EC2 Data Pipeline Role (which must trust ec2.amazonaws.com and have an instance profile)

    Note that we have two roles involved. Data Pipeline Role, which seems to be a sorta service role but
    doesn't have the same path/naming convention as other service roles, is used to actually call EC2 and
    spin up the target instance. It's meant to be accessible to datapipeline.amazonaws.com. Then, we have
    the EC2 Data Pipeline Role, which actually is accessible to the EC2 instance doing the computational
    work of the pipeline.

    Other works/blogs seemed to indicate the Data Pipeline Role was accessible, however that might not be true
    anymore? In any case, recent experimentation only allowed me access to the EC2 Data Pipeline Role.

    To create the list of edges, we gather our:

    * Potential Data Pipeline Roles
    * Potential EC2 Data Pipeline Roles

    Then we determine which of the EC2 roles are accessible to the Data Pipeline Roles, then run through all
    potential source nodes to see if they have the correct datapipeline:* + iam:PassRole permissions, then generate
    edges that have the EC2 roles as destinations.

    This vector is neat because even if specific EC2-accessible roles are blocked via ec2:RunInstances, this might be
    an alternative option the same as autoscaling was.
